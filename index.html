			<center><h3>What is "DifferentlyAbled"?</h3></center>
			<p>One person in five suffers from a disability. Although strides have already been made in improving the accessibility of products, services, and technology, there still remains a lot to be accomplished. We hope that through spreading awareness, we will be able to bring positive change to the lives of billions of differently abled people across the globe.</p>

						<td><center><p>Helen is a junior at University High School who was inspired by her summer at Intel through the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program to use the power of code for the benefit of society. She was interested in creating a game and in raising awareness about a problem that often overlooked by society and the government, which led to the creation of DifferentlyAbled. She worked primarily on the project's backend, such as the JavaScript games and the map code.</p></center></td>
						<td><center><p>Isabelle is a junior at University High School who is passionate about social entrepreneurship and innovating for social good. After participating in Ted Drake's accessibility workshop and performing hands-on experiments in the user experience labs at Intuit's headquarters last summer, she has been inspired to use her skills to assist the differently abled. She worked primarily on DifferentlyAbled's front end through building the webpage, designing game and map graphics, and helping to produce the video.</p></center></td>
